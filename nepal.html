Thank you all for your incredible work so far. The #StanfordForNepal campaign is working hard to coordinate existing efforts on campus and bring broader awareness to these initiatives. We have included in this note a digest of a few student- and staff-led initiatives that have been made known to us. If you know of others, please email Lina Vadlamani at linav16@stanford.edu so we can continue to spread the word about the work coming from members of the Stanford community.

2. A Supplies Drive through Help Kids in Nepal <br> <br> 
Help Kids in Nepal is collecting items (health & hygiene, first aid kit) and raising funds to support the earthquake victims in Nepal. The raised items are sent to Nepal via airlines, cargo or individual volunteers who are visiting Nepal from the US. The funds raised have been either utilized to buy these items to be sent to Nepal (if not collected enough) or the money is directly sent to our Help Kids in Nepal coordinator in Kathmandu, Nepal. <br>


Our little effort can help safe lives of earthquake victims in Nepal. If youhave any items to donate, or have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact Richa at 713.376.0459, richasra@gmail.com, or Purna Sherpa at 650.704.2005, americansherpa@yahoo.com. <br> <br>

3. Geospatial mapping to support the relief efforts <br> <br>
If you want to contribute IMMEDIATELY to ongoing Humanitarian Mapping efforts for Nepal through Humanitarian OpenStreetMap.org, please do the following: <br>
Go through the 30 minute training on http://mapgive.state.gov to learn the basics of humanitarian mapping using OpenStreetMap.org <br>
Then go to the HOTOSM Task Manager at http://tasks.hotosm.org/ and select a job that you feel comfortable contributing to. Read the directions carefully for the job, then select one of the squares next to one that is marked as complete. This will allow you to pan to the completed square so you can see how others are digitizing the features and mimic their work.
It doesn't matter how long you work, or how many features you digitize. There are currently hundreds of people mapping on HOTOSM for the Nepal Earthquake. Every edit counts! <br> <br>

4. Grants made available for Nepali students by the Emergency Student Fund and Institute of International Education (IIE) <br> <br>

To financially assist Nepali students studying in the US nationally, the Institute of International Education (IIE) has announced an emergency grant program.  I have sent this information to TJ Fletcher in Student Services, as well as Nanci Howe, and thestanfordnepaligroup@lists.stanford.edu.  If you hear of anyone struggling financially with losses back home and are interested in this opportunity, please contact them to either TJ Fletcher in Student Services or an advisor at the ICenter. <br>

Message from IIE: <br> 
In light of the tragic events in Nepal, the Emergency Student Fund (ESF) of the Institute of International Education (IIE) http://www.iie.org/Who-We-Are is issuing a call for nominations from United States colleges and universities who have Nepali students on campus with urgent financial need due to the devastating earthquake in Nepal.  IIE's Nepal-ESF will provide emergency grants of up to $2,000 each to Nepali students nominated by their U.S. host colleges and universities who are unable to continue or complete their degree program in the U.S. due to serious financial difficulties precipitated by the natural disaster in their home country.  Accredited U. S. campuses are invited to nominate up to 5% or 3 (whichever is greater) of the Nepali students at their institutions for whom help is needed to complete their studies in the United States.  International Student Advisers or other campus officials should complete the Nepal-ESF nomination form and e-mail it to ESF@iie.org  by May 15th, 2015, 5:00pm EDT.  Awards will be announced by May 29th. Applications directly from students will NOT be accepted. U.S. host campuses nominating students for Nepal-ESF awards are expected to provide some emergency assistance to the nominated students, through tuition waivers, full or partial scholarships, housing, stipends, loans, work study, or other forms of support. <br> <br>

5. An IndieGogo Campaign for Nepal Earthquake Relief <br> <br>
As you may see in our campaign (Igg.me/at/nepquake), we are focusing on providing resources to local NGOs who do not have access to the same level of international capital that large organizations with high administrative fees do. Although INGOs do a great job, they often send only temporary relief fund. Local NGOs not only know the location better, which is crucial given the terrain of Nepal and the lack of proper address, but are also here for the long term. A key recurring theme in catastrophe management is the lack of resources in the local community organization. We see this in Nepal and want to ensure that those who know best, have the resources to do their best. We have already started to identify local NGOs who are working on women, children and sanitation issues as these are the most pressing needs and ones that need sustained support. Providing support to these local NGOs is key for us. <br>
Our campaign page has updates on the logistical details. We are using Global Shapers, an initiative of the World Economic Forum, as a conduit to get the funds to Nepal and disburse them to local NGOs who most need it. As you will see on our campaign updates we have started to identify these local organizations and are in the process of vetting them. You can read more about Global Shapers at: https://www.globalshapers.org/hubs/kathmandu <br>

6. A message from Dr. Michele Barry, Senior Associate Dean of Global Health and Director of the Center for Innovation in Global Health <br> <br>
Our hearts go out again to those in Nepal. Two earthquakes in less than a monthâ€™s time is two too many. Fortunately the epicenter of this second earthquake is in an area that is less populated. <br>
Paul Auerbach, who is back from the April 25 quake, shared several first-hand accounts from his time on the ground, which are available here. Rebecca Walker remains in Nepal supporting the efforts of the Nepal Ambulance Service (NAS).
The Nepalese Ministry of Health recently asked that FMTs ready to deploy to Nepal should refrain from doing so as the current need had been met. Anyone interested in participating in the relief efforts in-person should keep apprised of the situation and do so in coordination with an official agency approved to be in Nepal. <br>
As Paul reiterates in his most recent post, monetary donations will continue to be essential to sustaining response efforts and protecting the health of Nepalâ€™s people. We continue to keep Nepal in our thoughts. <br>
