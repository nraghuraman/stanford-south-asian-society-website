# stanford-south-asian-society-website
This is the website for Stanford South Asian Society. You can visit the website at southasiansociety.stanford.edu.

Most of the code in this repository is not my own. Much of the credit goes to the original creators of the website, whose work I updated. With that being said, I did substantially update the overall design of the website as well as its contents.

I'm proud of how this website turned out. However, here are some potential areas for improvement:
1. Though I'm altogether happy with the final look of the website, the UI can still be improved. For example, there's a space that I've had trouble removing between the footer of the front page and the image. Separately, the "Team SAS" page has some text that awkwardly runs onto new lines with different indentation.
2. I'd be interested in hearing from Stanford students who have visited the site. Did they find that the information was useful and made them interested in getting involved with South Asian Society? Based on what they say, I'd love to update the website accordingly.
